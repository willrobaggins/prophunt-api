# prophunt-api
The prophunt API is divided into two separate applications. 
You will primarily want "props_api", as this is the main api (similar to Idyl's) which handles the props and hiding.
The second api, lobby_api, will add the functionality for lobbies. You do not need this if you do not want it, but it is available.

NOTE: the plugin will listen for:
        props_api => port 8080
        lobby_api => port 5000
